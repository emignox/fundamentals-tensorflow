## Hello every one here the documetation of my studyies/fundamentals  in tensorflow,
### first we import  tensorflow in out file python **first-section**:
* we start creating differet cosntant and vectors
* check the dimension and the shape of them to understand better what they are
*  make differrence between scalar, vectors, matrix  an tensor

 # then we  see how to create random tensors that help us to work and  teach us how to manage bigger data and control them,

* shuffle them
* make them all 0,
* make them all one

ps. here i started to feel like a genius :P

* introducing numpy discovering is possible to manage the data with numpy or creating tensor with it.

  # here we see how much information we can have from tensor to manage the at the best

# in order we follow with some masic mathematical operations with the tensor
* + - * /
* using tf.matmul
* learning how if tensors are in different shape this will not work ðŸ˜„
* learning to transpose that change the order of a tensor
* and usig tf.reshape that change the shape of a tensor
* we learned also how to change is datattype using tf.cast() method.
* squeezing a tensor ( squeeze = tf.squeeze(G) )
   



# Here we  do the aggregation of tensors

# one of the most important is the ONE_HOT_ECODING method 
## this givves you the possibiliti to trandorm your  tensor in float  numbers in   0 and 1  
### in this form the model will treat our tensor with  datalabels in true or false for example.
